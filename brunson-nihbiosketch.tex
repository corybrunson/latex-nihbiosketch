\section{Personal Statement}

\begin{statement}

%OVERVIEW
Following my PhD in Mathematics, a research assistantship in social network analysis, and an adjunct professorship, I completed two postdoctoral fellowships at UConn Health in the Center for Quantitative Medicine (CQM).
I was first hired in 2014 to train as a data scientist under the supervision of Dr. Reinhard Laubenbacher, and I pursued a variety of projects with different collaborators during this time.
In 2017, I was awarded a fellowship with the UConn--NIDCR T90/R90 Research Training Program under Dr. Mina Mina. My project focused on network analysis and modeling of routinely-collected healthcare data sets (``health data'').
I have worked at the University of Florida since 2020 as an Assistant Professor, during which time I have initiated collaborations with several colleagues. I arrived at the focus of this proposal through regular research fora in the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine.

%PROJECTS
My research involves descriptive and predictive modeling approaches to biomedical problems.
This involves several specific focus areas:
I am completing a study that uses localized models to predict and identify personalized risk factors for readmission and mortality among critical care patients.
I currently collaborate with a team of specialists in interstitial lung disease and lung transplantation to detect, measure, and explain socioeconomic disparities in post-transplant outcomes.
I also collaborate with a group of psychiatrists and psychologists to identify personal and societal determinants of behavioral treatment response.
Finally, I am working with a team of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency specialists to develop a simple and interpretable risk score for abnormal genotype.

%METHODS
Each of these projects involves heterogeneous, patient-level data, with attendant privacy considerations, quality concerns, and pre-processing needs.
Following the informatics focus of my postdoc, I work with data of varying provenances, including electronic health records, billing claims, patient registries, public repositories, and clinical trials.
I devote considerable effort to data quality, including an understanding of data collection and scrutiny of missingness patterns, and I have extensive experience cleaning, linking, and organizing data sets.
%I implement and design original approaches to data analysis that exploit tools from topology, the mathematical study of continuity. These include localized approaches to outcomes research based on patient similarity as well as extensions to and generalizations of network models in systems medicine.
In all of my work i emphasize research transparency and reproducibility. This includes making analysis code and its history available online but also encapsulating essential methods into open source software packages that others can modify and use.
This proposal deploys my background in data quality, predictive modeling, and reproducibility toward an urgent issue in patient care.

\section{Contribution to Science}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \emph{Network science.}
As a Research Assistant and mentor, together with a team of undergraduates, I was introduced to network analysis and scientometrics at a summer program organized around systems biology.
Our study of the mathematics literature, and a later collaboration focused on biomedicine, combined conventional and original tools to describe global changes in collaboration patterns in both communities over recent decades, and our results have been cited in both follow-up research and several commentaries on scientific practice.
I have since kept up an active program of network science, which has involved collaborations with domain experts in immune response and cell biology on original applications of advanced graph theory to modeling cell signaling and capillary development.
Network science has also been a major part of my more recent work involving administrative healthcare data, as detailed in the next section.

\end{enumerate}

\item \emph{Health informatics.}
I self-trained at CQM as a data scientist, which entails a combination of statistical literacy, computational programming, and consultancy, with a focus on the pre-processing, analysis, and modeling of administrative healthcare data sets.
I conducted a systematic review of studies that use network analysis to study healthcare data, a literature that contains myriad projects in diverse domains. My review synthesized this literature and taxonomized its methods in service to the field, but it also revealed to me that the increasingly popular use of ``comorbidity networks'' suffers from inconsistent methodology and uncertain validity. In response, and with a physician--informaticist colleague, we conducted a sensitivity analysis of techniques that have been used to study comorbidity networks, which we hope will encourage more consistent and transparent work in future.
In addition to my scientific work, I completed a training collaboration with the Office of the State Comptroller of Connecticut, analyzing prescription patterns in claims data as part of an investigation into compound pharmacy fraud, and I collaborated with a pharmacist--scientist to develop a set of software packages to expedite comparative effectiveness research using claims databases.

\end{enumerate}

\item \emph{Descriptive and predictive modeling.}
Since joining the University of Florida (UF), I have begun collaborations with several clinician--researchers, in Psychiatry, Psychology, and Family Medicine as well as in Pulmonary.
My work includes some conventional statistical analysis, for example to describe determinants of healthcare worker burnout during the pandemic or to predict post-transplant outcomes among lung recipients, and I use my background in reproducibility to ensure in each case that my analysis is reproducible, auditable, and reusable.
I have also worked to bring somewhat niche geometric and topological data analysis techniques into more mainstream use by way of open source software development.
My primary methodological project, however, has been to couple an artificial intelligence approach called case-based reasoning into a machine learning framework in order to improve the predictive accuracy of models without cost to their interpretability. We are using these ``localized'' models to enhance mortality prediction in ICU and cardiac outcomes for COVID-19, using patient data obtained from electronic health records. Several manuscripts are submitted or in preparation, and this approach is the basis for my CTSI Precision Health Initiative pilot award.

%\item \emph{Topological data analysis.}
%My scientometric work raised a remarkably under-studied question: How can triads of actors be understood in an affiliation network context? A satisfactory answer required the machinery of homological algebra, which had been essential to my dissertation project but which had not been adapted to this setting. As I came to appreciate the limitations of network analysis to exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and hypothesis testing with healthcare data, this success was an important factor in my decision to pursue topological data analysis (TDA). My TDA work, joint with mathematical and clinical collaborators, is focused on two entangled research programs. One is to couple topological methods with complex predictive models in order to identify health-related features and patient phenotypes that help explain the predictions and the performances of these models. This is joint work with mathematical and clinical collaborators, including MD--PhD student Yara Skaf, who has been instrumental to its design and conduct since she joined our lab and will co-author our first manuscript. The other is to synthesize existing and original TDA tools into a collection of software packages integrated into widely-used data science conventions, in order to make rigorous and efficient topological methods accessible to data scientists. This is joint work with student researchers at several institutions, including Ms. Skaf, and serves an important role in allowing student researchers to participate directly in methods development and experimentation. My own primary project is a topological approach to the problem of the unequal performance of predictive models in healthcare, which connects to work in health disparities, algorithmic bias, and algorithmic stewardship.

%\end{enumerate}

%More recently, I mentored a team of undergraduates in developing risk models for myocardial infarction (MI) using the open-access critical care database MIMIC-III. We built analysis pipelines to contribute to the MIMIC-III code repository and built several MI triage and risk models, which are being written up for submission to a medical journal.
